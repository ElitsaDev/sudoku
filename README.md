# About game
Sudoku is a popular logic puzzle with numbers. Its rules are quite simple, so even beginners can handle the simple levels.
Each 3×3 block can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
Each vertical column can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
Each horizontal row can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
Each number in the 3×3 block, vertical column or horizontal row can be used only once.
The game is over when the whole Sudoku grid is correctly filled with numbers.

# Used technology
I have used module JS, so live server will serve content of application. It can't use FTP protocol.

1. To start application locally you have to install lite-server (serve application on localhost:3000) or live server
- npm install -g lite-server
or find extention Live Server by Ritwick Dey and install it (serve application on localhost:5000):
