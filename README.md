# sudoku
Interactive Application - Vanilla JavaScript

# About game
Sudoku is a popular logic puzzle with numbers. Its rules are quite simple, so even beginners can handle the simple levels.
Each 3×3 block can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
Each vertical column can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
Each horizontal row can only contain numbers from 1 to 9.
Each number in the 3×3 block, vertical column, or horizontal row can be used only once.
The game is over when the whole Sudoku grid is correctly filled with numbers.

# Used technology
I have used the module type of JavaScript because the application is split into several files according to the logic problems to be solved. The live server will serve the content of the application. It can't use the FTP protocol.

1. To start the application locally you have to install lite-server (serve the application on localhost:3000) or live server
- npm install -g lite-server
or find the extension Live Server by Ritwick Dey and install it (serve the application on localhost:5000):

# Features
The user can solve a random puzzle generated by the app by clicking the _Load_ button. 
While the user solves the puzzle a timer counts down the elapsed time. If the user clicks on the _Pause_ button, the puzzle will be hidden and the timer will stop at the current time. 
When a user decides he is ready, he can check his solution with a _Check!_ button. If it is wrong or incomplete,some cells of the board will be colored red.
